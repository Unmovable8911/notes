## 2.1 Moving around
| Keystroke        | Action                | Keystroke        | Action                |
| :---:            | ---                   | :---:            | ---                   |
| j / `CTRL-N` / - | move down             | k / `CTRL-P` / + | move up               |
| h / `BACKSPACE`  | move left             | l / `SPACE`      | move right            |
| w                | move one word forward | W                | ignore punctuations   |
| b                | move one word backward | B               | ignore punctuations   |
| e                | move to the end of the word | E          | ignore punctuations   |
| G                | Goes to last line     | gg               | go to the first line  |
| 0 (zero)         | beginning of the line | $                | end of the line       |

You can combine commands with *numbers* to repeate command *number* of times.
For example, if you type `5j`, the cursor will move five lines down.
## 2.2 Simple edits
- `i`: insert text before the cursor  
    `I`: Insert text before the first character of the current line  
- `a`: append text after the cursor  
    `A`: Append text at the end of the line
- `x`: delete the current character  
    `X`: delete the character before the cursor
- `c`: change text  
    `cc`: change the current entire line  
    `C`: Change the from the cursor to the end of the line
- `s`: substitute, delete the current character and starts *insert* mode  
    `S`: Substitute the current entire line
- `d`: delete text  
    `dd`: delete the current line  
    `D`: delete to the end of the line
- `r`: replace the current character  
    `R`: Replace text, start from the current character
- `p`: put the deleted or yanked text after the cursor,   
    `P`: Put the deleted or yanked text before the cursor  
    *if the text is an entire line, put the text under (or above) the current
    line, no matter the column of the cursor*
- `y`: yank (copy) text  
    `Y`: yank the current line  
    `yy`: equal to `Y`
- `~`: change case, for example, change capital letter to lower case letter,
  vice versa.
- `u`: undo. **vi** can only undo the last command, while *Vim* can undo
  infinite number of previous commands  
    `U`: Undo changes made to the current line
- `o`: open a new line beneath the current line and starts *insert* mode  
    `O`: Open a new line above the current line and starts *insert* mode
- `J`: Join two lines into one line
- `.`: d~~ot~~uplicate command, repeat the previous command
- `xp`: command combination, transposing two letters
- `+`: first character of the next line  
- `-`: first character of the previous line

In *Vim*, you can redo the undos with `CTRL-R`.

Except for `o` and `O`, the *insert* commands listed above can take *numeric*
prefixes.

Some *number*, *command* combinations you may not expect:  
- `3i*`: insert three asterisks (`***`)
- `5A-`: Append 5 hyphens (`-----`) at the end of the line
- `4r=`: replace 4 characters, starts from the current one, with 4 equal signs
  (`====`)
## 2.3 General form of *vi* commands
*vi* and *Vim* commands consists of three parts:  
*\[command\]\[number\]\<text object\>* or *\[number\]\[command\]\<text object\>*

*command* and *number* are optional, without them, you are just moving around in
the file by *text object*.

Some *commands* don't require *text object*. For example, `r`, `i`, `~`, etc.
But you can combine them with *numbers* to repeat the command multiple times by
prefixing a *number*.
## Settings
- `wrapmargin` or `wm` option can automatically wrap a line when its length
  reaches the value you specified.Usage:  
    `:set wm=100`, `:set nowm`, `:set nowrapmargin`
- `number` or `nu` option can add a line number before a line. Usage:   
    `:set number`, `:set nu`, `:set nonumber`
